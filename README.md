# Studio \#1 for COSC416A: Game Development with Unity

By: Ariana Rice, student number: 24816522

## About This Project

A simple Unity 3D project comprised of:
- A Ball that moves using WASD keys and **jumps** using spacebar
- An environment with 4 walls and a floor for the Ball to move around in

## Video Demo

Note: I think my laptop was lagging a bit towards the middle/end of the recording... my actual implementation looks smoother, as seen in the first 10 seconds
